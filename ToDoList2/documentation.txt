We are going to create a to-do list app. In which we will be able to do basic CRUD taks.
CRUD - create, Read, Update, Delete

We are going to use Django as backend and react.js as frontend for this project.
There are two steps involved in this process:
    1. Making an api using Django as backend
        made a new app api
        we add url in urls.py file
        added new app api in settings
        Added differnt methods for the api

    2. Rendering views using React.js as front-end
        componentDidMount in reactcycle is a lifecycle method
        For every step we need to call the api method we created using the Django
        Then we need to bring the frontend in the same directory as our project.
        and run build command to make the frontend.
