We are going to create a to-do list app. In which we will be able to do basic CRUD taks.
CRUD - create, Read, Update, Delete

We are going to use Django as backend and react.js as frontend for this project.
There are two steps involved in this process:
    1. Making an api using Django as backend
        made a new app api
        we add url in urls.py file
        added new app api in settings

    2. Rendering views using React.js as front-end
